# Gishu_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Project Summary:
The goal of this project is to store the statistics of every player in the MLS, NHL, and NBA from the 2014/2015 regular season. The statistics will be a select chosen few, including goals, assists, save percentage, field goal percentage, minutes played, and more. Users will be able to choose from a variety of menu options that allow them to manipulate the data. Some of these options will include sorting the players on a team by a specific stat, listing a teams roster alphabetically, printing team totals, and listing the teams in a league alphabetically. The three leagues will be stored in a vector, while a tree will be built of all the teams in that league, and a hash table will store the roster for every team.
